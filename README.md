evelop a user-friendly and visually engaging application by designing its interface and flow using Figma, 
ensuring seamless navigation and an intuitive experience. Leverage the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to maintain a clean, 
efficient, and easily scalable codebase throughout the development process. 
Incorporate local database and SharedPreferences  to securely store and manage user data, enabling the app to function effectively without internet access. 
Further enhance the appâ€™s capabilities by integrating Generative AI technologies, such as the Gemini API, to deliver innovative and intelligent features that elevate user engagement.
